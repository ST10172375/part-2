BASED ON THE LECTURERS FEEDBACK
The program CookBook_2 now uses a generic collection to store the recipe, ingredients, and steps. The user can now enter an unlimited number of recipes, the program does this by making use of Lists to store the ingredient and steps. The program also gives the user the ability to enter the name of recipe that they want to create, that very same is going to be used when the user wants to view a certain recipe. Another change is that the user can now include the number of ingredients and type of food group when creating a recipe, the program then calculates and display the total number of calories that the recipe contains.
